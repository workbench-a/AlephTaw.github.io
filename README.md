# Welcome to my Notebook Blog

### This blog:

1. Takes Jupyter Notebooks (converted to markdown using nbconvert), and serves them using the Fast.ai template (based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/))
2. May eventually be used to serve documentation, tutorials, and projects related to my other projects, but, for now, it just exists as a proof of concept and for testing.
3. It is hosted with GitHub pages here: https://alephtaw.github.io/
